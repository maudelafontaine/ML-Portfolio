# ML Portfolio :computer::page_facing_up::mortar_board:

I recently graduated from Concordia Full-Stack Web Development bootcamp in Montreal, Qc, Canada.

I have created a portfolio in which I have included

- the projects that I've worked on and what I'm currently working on
- my contact information
- my background story
- my resume
